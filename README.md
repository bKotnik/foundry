# foundry
Solidity course project in foundry framework

## configuration
There are some requirements for the project to work.<br>
We need to add 2 files which contain some private data.
These files need to be in the root project folder.
- .env
    - GOERLI_RPC_URL = https://goerli.infura.io/v3/{infura_api_key}
    - ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = {etherscan_api_key}
- .secret -> seed phrase (e.g. from metamask)
